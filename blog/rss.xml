            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was a lot of positive progress. No major technical issues came up that impeded my work (until the end with the markdown editor, but I'll get to that in a bit). I am waking up consistently at 4am every day, and most days I am able to work until 7 or 7:30am before I have to switch off to do paying work, or family obligations, or other things. Being able to get enough time to actually put toward this project is a big concern for me. Staying motivated to continue to work on it, and being able to fit in the time to work on it.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="landing-page-feedback">Landing Page Feedback<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/2024-03-03-weekly-standup#landing-page-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Landing Page Feedback" title="Direct link to Landing Page Feedback">​</a></h3>
<p>This week I showed the landing page to people on the IndieHackers group and asked for feedback. Some of it was good feedback, some of it wasn't, and some of it missed the mark. It reminds me of writing workshops where, ultimately, whether or not to take a bit of feedback is up to you. For most of it I'll have to gradually improve as I develop this application.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the complaints was too much text (what? is that possible?! lol), which is probably true. But I don't yet have a lot of images or screenshots to replace that text with. Since this is a work in progress, I'll gradually add additional screenshots as I work on them.</p>
<p>I think the biggest, most consistent, issue was the big logo in the middle:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="landing page" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/landing-page-ca4ad3e89c3fbd0c67b5031c9a0042dc.png" width="1298" height="1014" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Reviewers, rightly, said that it was too big, and took too much attention for being non-functional. I see the point and agree. The simplest fix is to just remove the logo from that spot completely. Who cares about my logo, anyway.</p>
<p>Another complaint was that the call-to-action (Get Early Access) was too far down the page. It needs to be "above the fold." I can only guess they were looking at this webpage on one of those foldable phones, this isn't a newspaper, there is no fold! ...I kid. As you can see from the screenshot above, on my monitor at least, the call-to-action IS above the fold. Getting rid of the big logo will move it up the page, though, which means the fix for the first two issues is the same! That always feels like a programming win.</p>
<p>Another legitimate issue is that changing the theme to the light theme has some color problems. It certainly does! Not sure what kind of mad person chooses the light theme, but I definitely need to fix that.</p>
<p>Some people complained about the screenshot not looking "polished", but for me, that is a feature, not an issue. Every week I plan on updating the screenshot, and hopefully each week it will get better and better. (This person didn't even see the FIRST screenshot, they would have been appalled!)</p>
<p>Someone mentioned that I need social proof. Not sure how to get that right now, since the product isn't usable yet. Maybe I could put a bunch of logos up of companies that I think would love to use this product?</p>
<p>I think that was the main feedback, which all-in-all is pretty good. Some other feedback was about tightening up and improving the language, and explaining better what this application does. I agree with that too. You can always get better with those things.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="landing-page-purpose">Landing Page Purpose<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/2024-03-03-weekly-standup#landing-page-purpose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Landing Page Purpose" title="Direct link to Landing Page Purpose">​</a></h4>
<p>I think it is important to note that right now, six to nine months out from even considering having a single adopter, my main goal with the landing page is to just get a couple people who would be willing to be those first adopters. I want someone willing to be the guinea pig and actually be the first company to try the application. To that end, having a landing page which is slightly unpolished, and still gets someone intrigued enough to want to try the application is a good thing.</p>
<p>Getting people to want to try Big Picture is going to be far, far, far harder than actually writing the software. Which is why I am spending time on "marketing" now. Writing these blog posts is a minimum, I plan on doing additional work in this area in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="editing-tasks-and-subtasks">Editing Tasks and Subtasks<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/2024-03-03-weekly-standup#editing-tasks-and-subtasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Editing Tasks and Subtasks" title="Direct link to Editing Tasks and Subtasks">​</a></h3>
<p>The main functionality progress this week is the ability to edit all the fields displayed on the task summary screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="task summary" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/editing-tasks-723f2a138538be922150e70fbb33bd78.png" width="1036" height="742" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Everything in the above screenshot is editable: priority, status, assignments, main description, and subtasks. The conversation section is not editable yet, and that is all mock data right now. I plan to start the conversations "epic" in mid-March.</p>
<p>You can add subtasks quickly right from this screen by clicking the subtask button next to the task title and filling in the popup form:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="create subtask" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/new-subtask-446294fd2ff3ad949d1ed0aa9a51d65b.png" width="716" height="197" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A lot of effort went into the editor (I am using <a href="https://milkdown.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milkdown</a> as the markdown editor), to get it displaying correctly with reasonable fonts and spacing and to size appropriately in all the screens where it is displayed. This editor is also displayed on the main new task page and in the add new message section on the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="editor" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/editor-ef5b57937dec769b9a64b6f8bc3eb1a3.png" width="975" height="162" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I don't feel like this work is anywhere near done, though. There is a lot more functionality I want to get working in this editor (@mentions, #tags, /commands, and <!-- -->:emojis<!-- -->) and I was disappointed by how difficult this was (even though Milkdown shows this functionality on their demo page), and how much code it is going to take to make it work. I am going to have to create an entire "epic" dedicated to just making this work. It will probably be a week of effort all by itself.</p>
<p>But for now, basic editing is working, and you can type text just fine. You can even paste screenshots into the editor:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="task with screenshot" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/task-with-screenshot-67c5cc2a8b11949cfec8f23f02ad77f2.png" width="1010" height="642" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Though, the screenshots are being saved embedded with the markdown text instead of being uploaded to the GCS file storage and being given a separate file ID. This is a fine compromise for the moment, but it is something I will need to work on as part of the "Milkdown Editor" epic.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-will-you-work-on-next-week">What Will You Work on Next Week?<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/2024-03-03-weekly-standup#what-will-you-work-on-next-week" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Will You Work on Next Week?" title="Direct link to What Will You Work on Next Week?">​</a></h2>
<p>I have two more weeks planned for the "tasks" epic, before I move on to the conversations epic. In the screenshots above, wherever you see conversation messages, those are all just dummy data and most of the conversation functionality does not work yet. Conversations will require me to implement websockets through my infrastructure. That week's blog post will likely be far more technical in nature and not have quite so many screenshots <!-- -->😄<!-- -->.</p>
<p>But that is a couple weeks out, yet. Next week I want to add some overall functionality to the activity view page. Right now I have this UI as placeholders:</p>

<p>Where the "collapse," "expand," "compact view", and "filter" buttons don't actually do anything yet. Currently this page shows a task with all their details. I want the collapse button to hide subtasks and comments. I want the compact view to hide descriptions. And I want the filter button to let people quickly find a specific issue, or show only items with certain priorities, assignments, or statuses. I might also play around with sort options in here. Currently everything is sorted by last modified date, but sorting by created date, or priority might be useful with certain filters.</p>
<p>The other thing I want to get finished next week is the task detail view. The screenshots above all just show the summary view which eliminates some fields (it only shows one assignment field for instance), doesn't display custom fields, and doesn't actually let you edit a title (which I may need to change in the future, perhaps with a dedicated button.) Currently clicking on a title navigates to the detail view. I don't anticipate the detail view being a lot of work (famous last words, I know.) It is mostly the same functionality as this summary view, but with some additional action options (like clone.)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! And again, if you've actually read this far and aren't signed-up for updates from the mailing list, you really should.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we continue down the development path of Big Picture, I think it will be a good practice to post weekly progress updates, a "stand-up" as it were. It will help me look back and see the decisions and progress that I make week to week, and it will help show different aspects of the project as it gets more and more mature.</p>
<p>I don't really know how long it will take to get to an MVP for Big Picture. But, in my head, I have September as a goal. I'm not sure how realistic that is. On some days I wake up thinking there is no way I could make that. Other days I feel like I will have an MVP version done long before that.</p>
<p>September or not, though, these stand-up posts will help chart the progress as I work.</p>
<p>The below updates constitute more than a week's worth of work. These recent changes probably represent closer to 2-3 weeks worth of work. I've been working on this project for a couple months now (since the first of December, really), so there are a lot of technical decisions already made that I've not covered in blog posts. But since this is the first "stand-up" post, there is more to cover this week than there will be in future weeks.</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tasks-roll-up-screen">Tasks Roll-Up Screen<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/2024-02-25-weekly-standup#tasks-roll-up-screen" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tasks Roll-Up Screen" title="Direct link to Tasks Roll-Up Screen">​</a></h4>
<p>Prior to an MVP, my first goal is to get to the point where I can "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dog food</a>" the product myself: using it to track the work that needs to be done and how close I am to being done.</p>
<p>This week let me see a big step toward that goal. I was able to create a good task "roll up" screen that shows the tasks, description, priority, status, and other details.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Task Rollup Screenshot" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/task-rollup-screenshot-0d56612ff77879ba5d4be0262c77cbe4.png" width="1336" height="972" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This screen is inspired by Microsoft Teams' (terrible) Channel view, where posts are shown as cards and topics with the replies to the posts summarized. It is a very unnatural way to view conversations in MS Teams, giving a single post far more weight than it really deserves. But what is bad for a conversation, I think is going to be a very easy and natural for tasks.</p>
<p>There will be other ways to view lists of tasks within Big Picture, of course, but I am hoping the roll-up view becomes a popular and well-liked view.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Create Task" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/create-task-screenshot-6243e58dd4641f32039a0f76fddd397e.png" width="975" height="350" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I spent some time on the create task screen, but only enough to create a rudimentary task. You can enter title and description for now. In the coming weeks I will improve this functionality.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="people-and-teams">People and Teams<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/2024-02-25-weekly-standup#people-and-teams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to People and Teams" title="Direct link to People and Teams">​</a></h4>
<p>My goal this month (through mid-March) is to get creating and viewing tasks working sufficiently. But along the way, I need to digress occasionally to build pieces that are building blocks for what I am working on. People and Teams are two of those features.</p>
<p>You can't assign someone to a task unless there is a list of "someones" somewhere. So these are the first versions of People and Teams screens:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="People Screenshot" src="https://bigpicture.site/assets/images/people-screenshot-cf504ca8880344943a87dbb0b4f0f2ee.png" width="1333" height="403" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The people screen is just a list of people right now with their handles pulled from their email addresses. There is an "epic" planned for later to flesh out people functionality including editing profiles and setting permissions. But for now, it is a quick way to invite a bunch of users (all fake email addresses in the screenshot) so that I can assign them tasks.</p>

<p>I haven't talked much about the backend, or even the tech stack, yet in this blog. I'll dedicate a full post to going over this in more detail. But at a high-level: it is microservice based, written in C#; using PostgreSql for the data store; RabbitMQ for message transport; and <a href="https://wolverine.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolverine</a> and <a href="https://martendb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MartenDb</a> for message bus and event store, respectively.</p>
<p>The backend changes this week were mostly API endpoints to support the task list screen, with only a few new events being published (mostly update task events: TaskDetailsUpdated, TaskAssignmentUpdated, etc...).</p>
<p>The other major new feature for the backend was the file upload to GCS. Integrating with the GCS API, and setting up streaming of files from the UI -&gt; gateway -&gt; Files microservice -&gt; GCS all without ever storing the full file in memory took some time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-will-you-work-on-next-week">What Will You Work on Next Week?<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/2024-02-25-weekly-standup#what-will-you-work-on-next-week" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Will You Work on Next Week?" title="Direct link to What Will You Work on Next Week?">​</a></h2>
<p>I hope to get more tasks functionality working. I want to get full editing of the tasks working, with all task details being editable. This does not include conversations for tasks. Right now, in the screenshots, all the conversation stuff is just placeholders, and it will continue to be placeholders until I get to the conversations epic (which I plan to start in mid-March).</p>
<p>I also want to get creating sub-tasks working, so that parent ↔ child relationships in tasks can be viewed.</p>
<p>And then, finally, I want to add more functionality to the tasks roll-up screen. Maybe add more of a collapsed view, and a natural way to display sub-tasks.</p>
<p>I can't believe you made it all the way to the end of this post! You should definitely enter your email and sign up for updates if you haven't already.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Organizations today manage their projects and work items in software like Jira, GitHub, Monday.com, Basecamp, AirTable, Asana, and more. Then they communicate about those work items in software like Slack, MS Teams, Discord, Google Chat, and WhatsApp. Companies have built integrations between all these applications, so a mention of a ticket in Slack can turn into a link to Jira. But the integrations are limited, and most importantly, the knowledge about the project being worked on becomes fragmented. In this example, the details of the issue are in Jira, but the conversation about the issue is in Slack.</p>
<p>Between the project management application, the communication application, the document management application (like Confluence, Sharepoint, Notion, GitHub Wiki (and other Wikis), GitLab, or more), and then even the source code control service itself (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket), knowledge about a project becomes fractured. To find out the history of a work item, or a project, or the current state, or the latest documentation, a person may have to bounce between a dozen different applications and search inside every one of them before they can get a clear view of a project. A “Big Picture” as it were.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution">The Solution<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#the-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Solution" title="Direct link to The Solution">​</a></h2>
<p>Big Picture aims to be the single source of communication and tracking for all details of projects at an organization. It aims to replace the project management application (Jira, Asana, etc…), the communication application (Slack, Teams, etc…), and the document management application (Confluence, Notion, etc…) with a single application that can handle the needs of organizations of any size.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="philosophy">Philosophy<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#philosophy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Philosophy" title="Direct link to Philosophy">​</a></h2>
<p>The following principals should inform the development of features as we work towards being feature-complete. Not all features can be fully realized in the MVP, but the basis for further direction of these features should exist.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="big-picture-is-the-primary-collaboration-tool">Big Picture is the Primary Collaboration Tool<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#big-picture-is-the-primary-collaboration-tool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Big Picture is the Primary Collaboration Tool" title="Direct link to Big Picture is the Primary Collaboration Tool">​</a></h3>
<p>If team members need to collaborate on any task, they should be able to do it in Big Picture. At the beginning this might mean chat messages and task tracking. But ultimately, it should include live meetings, white boards, screen sharing, and anything else that is relevant.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-are-a-first-class-entity">Teams are a First-Class Entity<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#teams-are-a-first-class-entity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Teams are a First-Class Entity" title="Direct link to Teams are a First-Class Entity">​</a></h3>
<p>Teams are a primary organization item and can be targets of conversations, assigned to tasks and projects. They can be uniquely named, and roles of the team members can be assigned (such as manager, team lead, etc…). Membership history is kept and can be viewed. Teams can even be organized and associated with other teams, such that a hierarchy of teams can be built, allowing upper management to view all their teams. People can be members of more than one team.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="people-have-history">People Have History<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#people-have-history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to People Have History" title="Direct link to People Have History">​</a></h3>
<p>The projects a person has worked on and the tasks they have done inform who they are to an organization. It should be easy to click on a person in a conversation (for instance) and see what projects they’ve worked on and who they have worked with. More than their job title and who they report to, their work history should help others place them in context in an organization.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conversations-happen-at-every-level">Conversations Happen at Every Level<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#conversations-happen-at-every-level" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conversations Happen at Every Level" title="Direct link to Conversations Happen at Every Level">​</a></h3>
<p>Every task, work item, or document can have a unique conversation associated with it. By default, team members assigned to a project can see these conversations, but anyone throughout the organization (as long as they have permissions to view a project) can be added to these conversations.</p>
<p>Conversations also happen above these levels. Conversation threads can belong to a Project, a Team, or even the entire Organization.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conversations-roll-up">Conversations Roll Up<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#conversations-roll-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conversations Roll Up" title="Direct link to Conversations Roll Up">​</a></h3>
<p>Conversations based on project items or documents can be viewed in aggregate at higher level project items, entire projects, or for teams. So, conversations about a specific task can be seen on the task itself, the parent story, the parent epic, and the parent project.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-story-is-a-placeholder-for-a-conversation">“A Story is a Placeholder for a Conversation”<a href="https://bigpicture.site/blog/big-picture-vision#a-story-is-a-placeholder-for-a-conversation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to “A Story is a Placeholder for a Conversation”" title="Direct link to “A Story is a Placeholder for a Conversation”">​</a></h3>
<p>When creating fields and details of a work item, the conversation about that item is the primary focus. To the point that things like acceptance criteria and task details can be added and edited via conversation messages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Along the way we will outline the goals of Big Picture, explain the value BP provides, ask for feedback, express frustrations, cry, scream, lose hair, get older, and ultimately realize things are actually working pretty well after all.</p>
<p>You will learn more about who I am, my (no-doubt) overly idealistic view of the world that informs this project, some technical details about how Big Picture is being built, and hopefully come away inspired by the moxy and audacity an undertaking such as this requires.</p>
<p>Sign-up below for updates and follow the progress of Big Picture as we go from conception to production and everything else along the way!</p>]]></content:encoded>
