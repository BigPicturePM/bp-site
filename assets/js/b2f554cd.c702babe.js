It will help me look back and see the decisions and progress that I make week to week, and it will help show different aspects of the project as it gets more and more mature. \\n\\nI don\'t really know how long it will take to get to an MVP for Big Picture. But, in my head, I have September as a goal. I\'m not sure how realistic that is. On some days I wake up thinking there is no way I could make that. Other days I feel like I will have an MVP version done long before that.\\n\\nSeptember or not, though, these stand-up posts will help chart the progress as I work.\\n\\nThe below updates constitute more than a week\'s worth of work. These recent changes probably represent closer to 2-3 weeks worth of work. I\'ve been working on this project for a couple months now (since the first of December, really), so there are a lot of technical decisions already made that I\'ve not covered in blog posts. But since this is the first \\"stand-up\\" post, there is more to cover this week than there will be in future weeks.\\n\\n## What Did You Work on This Week?\\n\\n### UI Updates\\n\\n#### Tasks Roll-Up Screen\\n\\nPrior to an MVP, my first goal is to get to the point where I can \\"[dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)\\" the product myself: using it to track the work that needs to be done and how close I am to being done. \\n\\nThis week let me see a big step toward that goal. I was able to create a good task \\"roll up\\" screen that shows the tasks, description, priority, status, and other details.\\n\\n![Task Rollup Screenshot](./task-rollup-screenshot.png)\\n\\nThis screen is inspired by Microsoft Teams\' (terrible) Channel view, where posts are shown as cards and topics with the replies to the posts summarized. It is a very unnatural way to view conversations in MS Teams, giving a single post far more weight than it really deserves. But what is bad for a conversation, I think is going to be a very easy and natural for tasks.\\n\\nThere will be other ways to view lists of tasks within Big Picture, of course, but I am hoping the roll-up view becomes a popular and well-liked view.\\n\\n![Create Task](./create-task-screenshot.png)\\n\\nI spent some time on the create task screen, but only enough to create a rudimentary task. You can enter title and description for now. In the coming weeks I will improve this functionality.\\n\\n\\n#### People and Teams\\n\\nMy goal this month (through mid-March) is to get creating and viewing tasks working sufficiently. But along the way, I need to digress occasionally to build pieces that are building blocks for what I am working on. People and Teams are two of those features. \\n\\nYou can\'t assign someone to a task unless there is a list of \\"someones\\" somewhere. So these are the first versions of People and Teams screens:\\n\\n![People Screenshot](./people-screenshot.png)\\n\\nThe people screen is just a list of people right now with their handles pulled from their email addresses. There is an \\"epic\\" planned for later to flesh out people functionality including editing profiles and setting permissions. But for now, it is a quick way to invite a bunch of users (all fake email addresses in the screenshot) so that I can assign them tasks.\\n\\n![Teams Screenshot](./teams-screenshot.png)\\n\\nThe teams lists is not too different from the people list. \\n\\n![Create Team Screenshot](./create-team-screenshot.png)\\n\\nI spent more time on the create team dialog, so that uploading a custom avatar for a team works (files are stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets, with a unique bucket being created for each tenant -- more on that feature in the coming months.)\\n\\nI also spent an unreasonable amount of time creating a color picker dialog that works with the theme colors for the site:\\n\\n![Color Picker](./colors-dropdown.png)\\n\\n### Backend Updates\\n\\nI haven\'t talked much about the backend, or even the tech stack, yet in this blog. I\'ll dedicate a full post to going over this in more detail. But at a high-level: it is microservice based, written in C#; using PostgreSql for the data store; RabbitMQ for message transport; and [Wolverine](https://wolverine.netlify.app/) and [MartenDb](https://martendb.io/) for message bus and event store, respectively.\\n\\nThe backend changes this week were mostly API endpoints to support the task list screen, with only a few new events being published (mostly update task events: TaskDetailsUpdated, TaskAssignmentUpdated, etc...).\\n\\nThe other major new feature for the backend was the file upload to GCS. Integrating with the GCS API, and setting up streaming of files from the UI -> gateway -> Files microservice -> GCS all without ever storing the full file in memory took some time.\\n\\n## What Will You Work on Next Week?\\n\\nI hope to get more tasks functionality working. I want to get full editing of the tasks working, with all task details being editable. This does not include conversations for tasks. Right now, in the screenshots, all the conversation stuff is just placeholders, and it will continue to be placeholders until I get to the conversations epic (which I plan to start in mid-March).\\n\\nI also want to get creating sub-tasks working, so that parent \u2194 child relationships in tasks can be viewed.\\n\\nAnd then, finally, I want to add more functionality to the tasks roll-up screen. Maybe add more of a collapsed view, and a natural way to display sub-tasks.\\n\\nI can\'t believe you made it all the way to the end of this post! You should definitely enter your email and sign up for updates if you haven\'t already."},{"id":"big-picture-vision","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/big-picture-vision","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-20-big-picture-vision.md","title":"Big Picture Vision","description":"Organizations today manage their projects and work items in software like Jira, GitHub, Monday.com, Basecamp, AirTable, Asana, and more.

But the integrations are limited, and most importantly, the knowledge about the project being worked on becomes fragmented. In this example, the details of the issue are in Jira, but the conversation about the issue is in Slack.\\n\\nBetween the project management application, the communication application, the document management application (like Confluence, Sharepoint, Notion, GitHub Wiki (and other Wikis), GitLab, or more), and then even the source code control service itself (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket), knowledge about a project becomes fractured. To find out the history of a work item, or a project, or the current state, or the latest documentation, a person may have to bounce between a dozen different applications and search inside every one of them before they can get a clear view of a project. A \u201cBig Picture\u201d as it were.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Solution\\n\\nBig Picture aims to be the single source of communication and tracking for all details of projects at an organization. It aims to replace the project management application (Jira, Asana, etc\u2026), the communication application (Slack, Teams, etc\u2026), and the document management application (Confluence, Notion, etc\u2026) with a single application that can handle the needs of organizations of any size.\\n\\n## Philosophy\\n\\nThe following principals should inform the development of features as we work towards being feature-complete. Not all features can be fully realized in the MVP, but the basis for further direction of these features should exist.\\n\\n### Big Picture is the Primary Collaboration Tool\\n\\nIf team members need to collaborate on any task, they should be able to do it in Big Picture. At the beginning this might mean chat messages and task tracking. But ultimately, it should include live meetings, white boards, screen sharing, and anything else that is relevant.\\n\\n### Teams are a First-Class Entity\\n\\nTeams are a primary organization item and can be targets of conversations, assigned to tasks and projects. They can be uniquely named, and roles of the team members can be assigned (such as manager, team lead, etc\u2026). Membership history is kept and can be viewed. Teams can even be organized and associated with other teams, such that a hierarchy of teams can be built, allowing upper management to view all their teams. People can be members of more than one team.\\n\\n### People Have History\\n\\nThe projects a person has worked on and the tasks they have done inform who they are to an organization. It should be easy to click on a person in a conversation (for instance) and see what projects they\u2019ve worked on and who they have worked with. More than their job title and who they report to, their work history should help others place them in context in an organization.\\n\\n### Conversations Happen at Every Level\\n\\nEvery task, work item, or document can have a unique conversation associated with it. By default, team members assigned to a project can see these conversations, but anyone throughout the organization (as long as they have permissions to view a project) can be added to these conversations.\\n\\nConversations also happen above these levels. Conversation threads can belong to a Project, a Team, or even the entire Organization.\\n\\n### Conversations Roll Up\\n\\nConversations based on project items or documents can be viewed in aggregate at higher level project items, entire projects, or for teams. So, conversations about a specific task can be seen on the task itself, the parent story, the parent epic, and the parent project.\\n\\n### \u201cA Story is a Placeholder for a Conversation\u201d\\n\\nWhen creating fields and details of a work item, the conversation about that item is the primary focus. To the point that things like acceptance criteria and task details can be added and edited via conversation messages."},{"id":"welcome-big-picture","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome-big-picture","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-19-welcome.md","title":"Kicking It Off","description":"Hello and welcome to Big Picture.
